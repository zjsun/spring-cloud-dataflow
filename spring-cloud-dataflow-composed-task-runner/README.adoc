= Composed Task Runner

A task that executes a tasks in a directed graph as specified by a DSL that is
passed in via the `--graph` command line argument.

== Overview
The Composed Task Runner parses the graph DSL and for each node in the graph it
will execute a restful call against a specified https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Cloud Data Flow]
instance to launch the associated task definition.  For each task definition that is executed the
Composed Task Runner will poll the database to verify that the task completed.
Once complete the Composed Task Runner will either continue to the next task in
the graph or fail based on how the DSL specified the sequence of tasks should
be executed.

== Graph DSL

The Graph DSL is comprised of Task Definitions that have been defined within
the Spring Cloud Data Flow server referenced by the data-flow-uri
(default: http://localhost:9393).
These definitions can be placed into a derived graph based on a DSL through
the use of sequences, transitions, splits, or a combination therein.

== Traversing the graph
Composed Task Runner is built using
https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/[Spring Batch]
to execute the directed graph.   As such each node in the graph is a
https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/domain.html#domainStep[Step].
As discussed in the overview, each step in the graph will post a request to a
Spring Cloud Data Flow Server to execute a task definition.  If the task launched by
the step fails to complete within the time specified by the `maxWaitTime`
property, a
org.springframework.cloud.task.app.composedtaskrunner.support.TimeoutException
will be thrown.  Once task launched by the step completes,
the ComposedTaskRunner will set the `ExitStatus` of that step based on the following rules:

* If the `TaskExecution` has an `ExitMessage` that will be used as the `ExitStatus`
* If no `ExitMessage` is present and the `ExitCode` is set to 0 then the `ExitStatus`
for the step will be `COMPLETED`.
* If no `ExitMessage` is present and the `ExitCode` is set to 1 then the `ExitStatus`
for the step will be `FAILED`.

If the state of any step in the graph is set to  FAILED and is not handled by
the DSL the Directed Graph execution will terminate.

=== Sequences
The Composed Task Runner supports the ability to traverse sequences of task
definitions.  This is represented by a task definition name followed by the
`&&` symbol then the next task definition to be launched.
For example if we have tasks AAA, BBB and CCC to be launched in sequence it
will look  like this:
```
AAA && BBB && CCC
```
image::{image-root}/basicsequence.png[basic sequence]

You can execute the same task multiple times in a sequence.  For example:
```
AAA && AAA && AAA
```
image::{image-root}/samejobsequence.png[basic sequence with repeated job definition]

If an `ExitStatus` 'FAILED' is returned in a sequence the Composed Task
Runner will terminate.  For example if `AAA && BBB && CCC` composed task is
executed and BBB fails.  Then CCC will not be launched.

=== Transitions
The Composed Task Runner supports the ability to control what tasks get
executed based on the `ExitStatus` of the previous task.  This is
done by specifying `ExitStatus` after the task definition followed by
the `->` operator and the task definition that should be launched based on
the result.  For example:
```
AAA 'FAILED' -> BBB 'COMPLETED' -> CCC
```
image::{image-root}/basictransition.png[basic transition]

Will launch AAA and if AAA fails then BBB will be launched.  Else if AAA
completes successfully then CCC will launch.

You can also have a sequence that follows a transition.  For example:
```
AAA 'FAILED' -> BBB && CCC && DDD
```
image::{image-root}/basictransitionwithsequence.png[basic transition with sequence]

Will launch AAA and for any `ExitStatus` that is returned other than 'FAILED' then
CCC && DDD  will be launched.  However if AAA returns 'FAILED' then BBB will
be launched, but CCC && DDD will not.

==== Wildcard
Wildcards are also supported in transitions.
For example:
```
AAA 'FAILED' -> BBB '*'->CCC
```
image::{image-root}/basictransitionwithwildcard.png[basic transition with wildcard]

In the case above AAA will launch and any `ExitStatus` other than FAILED will
launch CCC.

=== Splits
Allows a user to execute tasks in parallel.
For example:
```
<AAA || BBB || CCC>
```
image::{image-root}/basicsplit.png[basic split]

Will launch AAA, BBB and CCC in parallel.   When launching splits as a part of a
composed task all elements of the split must finish successfully before the
next task definition can be launched for example:
```
<AAA || BBB || CCC> && DDD && EEE
```
image::{image-root}/basicsplitwithsequence.png[basic split with sequence]

In the case above once AAA, BBB and CCC complete sucessfully then DDD and EEE
will be launched in the sequence enumerated above.  However if one of the task
definitions fails in the split then DDD and EEE will not fire.  For example if
BBB fails then AAA and CCC will be marked successful and BBB will be marked a
failure and DDD and EEE will not be launched.

== Configuration
