# Spring Cloud Dataflow TaskLauncher Function

This module provides a `Function` that uses the Data Flow REST client to launch a registered task on a configured https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-local-tasks[task platform].
The client must be configured to connect to a remote Data Flow Server, including any required authentication (see Configuration Options below).

## Beans for injection

You can import the `TaskLauncherFunctionConfiguration` configuration in a Spring Boot application and then inject the following bean.

`taskLauncherFunction`

You may inject this as `TaskLauncherFunction` which implements `Function<LaunchRequest,<Optional<Long>>`.

You can use `taskLauncherFunction` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `apply` method of the `Function` to launch a task.
The function takes a link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/dataflow/tasklauncher/LaunchRequest.java[LaunchRequest] as input.
This is a simple value object that specifies, at a minimum, the name of the task registered in Data Flow.
Optionally, you can pass command line arguments as a `List<String>` and deployment properties as a `Map<String, String>`.
The return value is an `Optional` containing the unique task ID of the launched instance if the launch request is successful.

NOTE: This version of the tasklauncher requires Spring Cloud Data Flow version 2.4.x or higher
